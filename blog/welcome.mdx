## This is Me!

:::info TL;DR;
I'm a passionate full-stack developer with strong focus on backend.
:::

My journey started in school, where I had my first contact with programming.
Since then it was clear that I'm going to study computer science.

After I got my bachelor degree I immediately started working at an IT consulting company.
Among programming languages like `C#` and `Python`, I really got to know frontend technologies in depth, especially `React`,
and also my beloved `TypeScript`.  
Setting up new projects and migrating legacy code helped myself immensely to consolidate my knowledge.
Since my drive to write modern software is huge, I immediately jumped on the `React` hooks train.
Back then, there really was a lack of libraries supporting form handling with `React` hooks and I also didn't like existing solutions at that point in time.
So I took quite some efforts after work to develop my own form library: [react-fluent-form](https://www.react-fluent-form.com/).

While one part of me loved the new way of `React`, the other part always sought to go more into the direction of backend.
In my next and current working place I started working with technologies like `Vue` quickly moving to setting up a test automation architecture using `Playwright` and finally to `Java` and `AWS` -
all on top of a monorepository-microservice project setup.  
Regarding `AWS` I was already certified as a Cloud Practitioner in my first company and `Java` was the main programming language in university anyway.
While I think that `Java` has its own benefits for me, it always felt like that it got into its years at some point (even with newer versions).
Don't get me wrong, I think `Java` has a great fit in the modern world, especially `Spring Boot`, but it never satisfied me personally.

For this reason, I always write my private projects in `TypeScript` + `Node.js`.
If you utilize the type system of `TypeScript` properly, you are able to work very efficient while being very flexible at any time.
Privately, I also moved from `REST`-like (I purposely say "like" because almost no one ever implemented REST as it was intended) API's to `GraphQL`.  
Lately I really found myself in the world of cryptocurrencies again, where I also started few private projects.
Since I like functional programming concepts a lot, one mainly being immutability, I'm also planning to get to know `Rust` much better in the future.

## About My Blog

The main intention of my blog is to give something back to the great dev community around the globe.
Be it Stack Overflow, Discord Channels or GitHub. But of course, this is also some kind of promotion for myself ðŸ˜„.

By no means my blog posts are deeply researched like you would do it for elaborations in the university.
What I can guarantee though is, that everything I write down is the best to my knowledge and belief (at that point in time).
I never jump to conclusions without taking my time to research properly.

In the end, I hope to help people around the world, by being part and actively contributing to the community. Any constructive criticism is highly appreciated.
